Lucky is highly customizable and supports the running of various custom scripts.
However, once the account password and backend entrance are leaked, it may bring unforeseen consequences.
Therefore, it is very important to set up a secure portal.
When you set the secure entry to 666, the Lucky login page will not be displayed when you visit http://{IP}:16601.
Instead, you will need to visit http://{IP}:16601/666. Therefore, please try to make the secure entry as complex as possible and use HTTPS when accessing from outside the network.

Default login : http://{IP address}:16601
Default Account Number : 666
Default Password : 666
